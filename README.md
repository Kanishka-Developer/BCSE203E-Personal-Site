# BCSE203E-Personal-Site

This is my personal site made **specifically** for the BCSE203E course. As per instructions, it was made using only HTML, and now I'm adding CSS to it as per the new instructions.

It should be accessible [here](https://kokoboi.netlify.app/), hosted on Netlify. If it isn't, then I'm probably working on it. Or I forgot to deploy it. Or I forgot to make it public. Or I forgot to make it private. Or I forgot to make it. Or I forgot to... you get the idea.
