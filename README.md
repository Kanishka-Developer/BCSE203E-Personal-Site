# BCSE203E-Personal-Site

This is my personal site made **specifically** for the BCSE203E course. As per instructions, it is made using HTML, and *only* HTML. No CSS, no JS, no PHP, no nothing. Just HTML.

It should be accessible [here](https://kokoboi.netlify.app/). If it isn't, then I'm probably working on it. Or I forgot to deploy it. Or I forgot to make it public. Or I forgot to make it private. Or I forgot to make it. Or I forgot to... you get the idea.
